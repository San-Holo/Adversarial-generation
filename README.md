# Adversarial-generation

Small exploration of generative models, starting with GANs and slowly going towards manifold based methods.
The structure of each GAN model is based on a github repo, from which I added some changes. I would like to thank its author and provide a link for it: https://github.com/unit8co/vegans.

Everything is coded with PyTorch, using its data structures to provide pipelines useful for training and inference.
